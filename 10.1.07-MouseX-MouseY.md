```
Graded

In p5.js, `mouseX` and `mouseY` are system variables that hold the current horizontal and vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer within the canvas area. They are updated continuously as the mouse moves, allowing you to track the mouse's position and use it to interact with your sketches.

## TODO part 1:
Complete todo part 1, once you are done, comment it with `//` out and move to the next item.

1. change the size of a `ellipse` 
2. change the colour of the background with your mouse
3. change the colour of `ellipse`
4. move the `ellipse` to follow your mouse (think James Bond)


## TODO2:
with all of part 1 commented out, do the final 2. 

5. move the `ellipse` in the opposite of your mouse 
6. move the `ellipse` 2X as fast as your mouse
