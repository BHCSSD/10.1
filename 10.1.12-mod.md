# How the Modulo Operation Works

The modulo operation, often referred to as "mod," finds the remainder when one number is divided by another. It's usually represented by the `%` symbol.

## Simple Explanation

1. **Division**: When you divide two numbers, you get a main answer and sometimes a remainder (what's left over).
2. **Modulo**: The modulo operation gives you just that remainder.

## Examples

- **Example 1:**
  - 10%3 
    - When you divide 10 by 3, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 1.
    - So,  10%3 = 1 .

- **Example 2:**
  -  14%5 
    - When you divide 14 by 5, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 4.
    - So, 14%5 = 4 .

The mod operation tells you how much is left over after dividing one number by another.


```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(800, 600);
    print("How do you tell if a number is odd or even?");
    print("Use MOD to find the remainder. MOD is the % sign");
    print(   );
    print (    );

    print("Divide the class of 31 into groups of 4");
    print("Number of groups: " + floor(     ) );  //floor round down
    print("Extra students: " +   (   ) );

}//end setup
```
