# **A Look at MVC**

MVC stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It's a way to organize code into three distinct sections:

1. **Model** – This part holds the data and logic. In our case, it includes variables and any data-related functions.

   * All variables and data-handling logic go here.
2. **View** – This part handles everything the user sees. It includes code related to drawing on the canvas.

   * All drawing and display logic go here.
3. **Controller** – This part manages user interaction and updates the model accordingly. It includes functions that handle mouse clicks, key presses, and other user inputs.

   * All interaction logic (like mouse clicks and key presses) goes here.
   * This can only update the variables in the Model, no drawing at all.


## **Model**

The model contains the variables and any logic that updates them.

```javascript
// Model
let lineY = 50;
```


## **View**

The view contains the `setup` and `draw` functions, which handle all rendering.

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 600);
    background(255, 255, 0);
} // end of setup

function draw() {
    line(50, lineY, mouseX, mouseY);
    // lineY+= 2
} // end of draw
```



## **Controller**

The controller handles user interactions and updates the model accordingly.

```javascript
// Controller
function mousePressed() {
    // empty for now.
} // end of mousePressed
```
