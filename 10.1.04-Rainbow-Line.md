# A look at MVC

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It's a way to organize code into three distinct sections:

1. **Model**: This part holds the data and the logic. In our case, it includes variables and any data-related functions.
   - All your variables and data logic go here.
2. **View**: This part handles everything the user sees. It includes code related to drawing on the canvas.
   - All your drawing and display logic go here.
3. **Controller**: This part manages user interaction and updates the model accordingly. It includes functions that handle mouse clicks, key presses, and other user inputs.
     - All your interaction logic (like mouse clicks and key presses) go here.


## Model
The model will contain the variables and their updates.

```javascript
// Model
let lineY = 50;

```

## View
The view will contain the `setup` and `draw` functions, handling all the rendering.

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 600);
    background(255, 255, 0);
}// end of setup

function draw() {
    line(50, lineY, mouseX, mouseY);
    //lineY = lineY + 2 // 
}// end draw
```

## Controller
The controller will handle interactions and updating the model.

```javascript
// Controller
function mousePressed() {
    // No interactions defined yet
}// end of mouse pressed


```
