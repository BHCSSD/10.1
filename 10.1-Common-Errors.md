## Some people want to watch the world burn:
Today we break things. 

Complete a few basic print statements such as: 
-  print(“Where does this print?”); //check quotes to make sure they work
-  text(“Ok, what about this?” 50,50);
-  String name = “student name”);
-  print(“Hello there “ + name); //What does the + do? 

## TODO:
test run a few errors before continuing.  You need to recognize the most common errors including:
1. Forgetting semi-colon
2. Unclosed quotes or brackets
3. mis-capitalization
4. Add 1 too many }
5. remove a }
6. Move a `text()` outside of draw


```javaScript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 500);
  background(52,217,197);
}//setup

function draw() {
  circle(mouseX,mouseY,66)

  stroke(50,50,200);
  strokeWeight(2);
  fill(250,160,80);
  rect(400,200, 150,75);
  
  stroke(50,50,200);
  strokeWeight(1);
  fill(250,200,80);
  ellipse(400, 200, 110, 80);
  
}//draw
/// camelCase

```
