```
# **Graded Assignment**

## **Marking Breakdown**

* **8 points** – Drawing the scene with all required elements (see below)
* **2 points** – Code is properly indented and tidy (ask me to show you what this looks like)

   * Includes clear and helpful comments, especially:

    * End-of-function comments like `} // end draw`
    * Descriptive comments for each section or shape (e.g. `// snowman head`, `// bat body`)
* **1 point** – One moving item created using a variable and an `if()` statement
  * Refer to **10.1.3 - Adding Text** for help with this
  * **Set up 1 point**

---

## **Setup**

1. Create a canvas that is **700 x 700** with a background color of your choice.
2. Inside the `draw()` function, add **three lines of text** somewhere in your canvas.

   * The content can be anything — the key is that **three separate lines** are drawn.

---

## **Main Task**

Your goal is to draw a creative scene of your own **or** choose from one of the following suggestions:

1. A house on a street
2. An old-school iPod
3. A car, truck, or submarine
4. A snowman ... has to be GOOOOOOOOOD 
5. A Minecraft Creeper
6. The Stanley Cup or another trophy
7. For a tougher challenge: a Canadian flag
8. **Or anything else you can imagine!**

---

## **Your drawing must include:**

* A **background color**
* **At least 10 shapes**, including the following:

  * **Lines**
  * **Rectangles or squares**
  * **Ellipses or circles**
  * Optional shapes: triangles, quads, arcs
  * 3 lines of `text()` 
* **Color variety**

  * Use `fill()` with **multiple colors**
  * You may use `random(255)` for dynamic colors
* **Different stroke weights**

  * Example: `strokeWeight(5);`

* Something moving on the screen. 

## **Clean Your code**
- you will get a mark on how clean your code is. If I forgot to explain this, ASK ME! 

---

## **Tips**

* Try `rectMode(CENTER);` — sometimes it makes placement easier.
* To return to the default: use `rectMode(CORNER);`
* Explore `noFill()` and `noStroke()` for cleaner visual effects.

## **Starter Code Example**

```javascript
function setup() {

//Link to an easy color picker:
//https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp

  createCanvas(300, 400);
  rectMode(CENTER);
} // end setup

function draw() {
  background(179, 89, 0);

  fill(221, 153, 255);
  rect(150, 30, 120, 80, 10);

  // At least 10 shapes
  // Use fill, stroke, strokeWeight
  // Include triangle, quad, or point (see reference if needed)
  // Include 3 lines of text
} // end draw

function mousePressed() {
  print(mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
} // end mousePressed
```
