## **Images How-To: Reminder**

1. **Save your images**

   * Stick to `.png`, `.gif`, or `.jpg` formats
   * Rename images using short, simple names
   * Do **not** include any spaces in the file or folder names

2. **Upload the images into the p5.js editor**

3. **Follow these 3 steps to load and display images**:

   * Set up variables to hold the images: `let bart;`
   * Create a `preload()` function to load the images into those variables
   * Use the `image()` function to draw the images on the canvas

# **Make a Scene from Your Favorite Cartoon**

## **TODO:**

### 1. Find and Prepare Images

* Choose 3 character images and 1 background image from a childhood cartoon you like
* Save and upload them to your p5.js sketch
* Use `image()` to display your characters and background
* Resize the images appropriately so that the scene looks balanced and intentional

### 2. Jitter Effect

* Apply a jitter effect to **one** of your characters using the `random()` function
* Randomly adjust the characterâ€™s `x` and `y` values each frame to create a jittery or shaky effect (like too much coffee)

### 3. Written Work: A Little Theory

* At the **top** (line 1) of your sketch, in a comment, explain the difference between **JPEG**, **GIF**, and **PNG** formats
* Include how many colors each format supports
