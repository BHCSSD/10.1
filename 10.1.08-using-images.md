## Images How-to: short version
1. save image
   - stick to .png or .gif or .jpg
   - rename them to have short names
   - do not have any spaces in the name
3. upload into P5
4. There are 3 steps to load images:

   - set up variables to hold images `let img1`
   - make `function preload()` load the images into the variables  
   - draw to screen using `image()`


# Make a Scene from your favorite Cartoon

## TODO:
1. Find Images:
     - Find images 3 characters along with a background that you'd like to display in your p5.js sketch. Make sure you have these image files saved and ready for use.
     - Use any of your favorite childhood tv shows.
     - Display your characters and background on your script. Make sure to resize them so it makes sense. 
  
2. Jitter Effect:
   -  Give one of you characters a jitter effect using the `random()` function to add random values to their x and y coordinates. The goal is to make them look like they had just a little too much coffee. 
3. A little theory
   - in a comment at the top of your code, tell me the difference between JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Also, tell me how many colors each file type supports.
