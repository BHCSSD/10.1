## **Goal:**

Create text and make it zoom across the screen.

---

## **TODO 1**

### **Part 1: Basic Setup (60%)**

1. Make a new file named exactly `10.1.03-adding-text`.
2. Copy the **starter code** from the bottom of this document.
3. In `createCanvas(x, y)`, set `x` to **600** and `y` to **400**.
4. Set your `background()` to an RGB color of your choice.
5. Add a `rect()` in the **middle of the screen**.
6. Inside the rectangle, add:

   ```js
   text("WORDS GO HERE", x, y)
   ```

   You need to change the text to anything appropriate.
7. In `setup()`, change the font size using `textSize(12)` and make the text **big**.
8. Add `noStroke()` on the line before your rectangle. What does it do? Add a comment (`//`) on line one explaining its effect.
9. Add a `fill()` before your `text()` to change the **color of the text only**.

---

### **Part 2: Movement Logic (10%)**

10. Inside `text()`, change the `x` value to the variable `textX` (already declared at the top of the code).
11. How can you make the text move from **left to right** across the screen?

* Hint: Use a new line like `textX += 5` (or another small number). This will change `textX` over time and make the text move.

---

### **Part 3: Conditional Logic (10%)**

12. To reset the text when it goes off the right side of the canvas, you’ll need an `if` statement.
    Below is a broken version—you need to **fix it** so the text goes off the screen, then **resets to the left side**:

```javascript
if (textX < -250) { // You will need to change the condition. What should it check for?
  textX = 0; // Reset the `textX` position
  print("too far to the right");
} // end of if
```

Fix the condition so it resets when the text leaves the right side.

---

## **TODO 2: Advanced Logic (10%)**

1. Create a **new variable** at the top of your code called `textY`.
2. Add a **second line of text** at the **bottom-left corner** of the screen.
3. Using your two variables (`textX` and `textY`), make that text move **diagonally upward** across the screen to the **top-right corner**.

---

## **Starter Code**

```javascript
let textX = 250;

function setup() {
  createCanvas();
  textSize(12);
} // end setup

function draw() {
  background(255);
} // end draw
```
