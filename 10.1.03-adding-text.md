 Our goal with this example is to make text and have it zoom past

  # TODO 1:
  ## Part 1: 60%
  1. Make a new File with `10.1.3-adding-text` as the name 
  2. Check your `createCanvas(x, y)` inside of `setup()`. Set x to 600, and y to 400
  3. inside the `draw` function set your background colour to an r,g,b: `background();`  your choice
  4. add a `rect()` to the middle of the screen
  5. inside the box add `text("WORDS GO HERE",x,y)`
  6. In your `setup` Change the font size `textSize(12)` and make it BIG
  7. add `noStroke()` in the line before your box, use a comment `//` to tell me what it does
  9. in the line before your `text` add `fill()` change the colour of the text only
      
## Part 2: some problem solving 70%
  10. inside of your `text()` change your number for the x value to the variable `textX` (this was set on line 1 of the code, it is a variable)
  11. with the idea that `textX` is a variable and can be changed, how can you make the text scoot off the screen from left to right? hint: start with a new line `textX = textX` and use this to change the x value using grade 1 math.
  12. I was going to put the answer to #8 here, but I decided to be a bit mean... good luck

## Part 3: more advanced problem solving 90%
  13. to reset the `text()` back to the other side of your screen, you need an if statement. I made this so it doesn't work. You need to fix it so your text goes off the right hand side of the canvas, it just back to the left hand side.
   
  **Copy and paste time:**

```javaScript   
  if (   textX < -250     ){ // you will need to edit the. If your x is __________ 
    textX=500;// reset the `textX` to a new position
    print("too far to the right");
    }
````


## TODO2: 100% 
1. make 1 new variable, `textY` at the top of the screen 
2. make a new line of text at the bottom left corner of the screen
3. using your 2 variables make the text go up in a diagonal line to the other corner 


## starter code
```javaScript
let textX = 250;

function setup() {
  createCanvas();
  
}

function draw() {
  background(255);

}

```
