Our goal today is simple: **learn to color inside the lines.**

---

## TODO: Part 1

1. Make a new file named `10.1.02-Drawing-Shapes`. You can use the copy button at the top.
2. Copy the **starter code** from the bottom of this document and paste it into the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). Make sure to **replace** their default starter code with mine.
3. Inside `createCanvas(x, y)`, change:

   * `x` to **400**
   * `y` to **400**
4. Inside `background()`, set any RGB color **except no green allowed**.

   * Add a comment beside it explaining what each number represents.

---

5. Find the lines that look like this:

```js
// function mousePressed() {
//   print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
// } 
```

* Delete the `//` at the beginning of each line to **uncomment** the code.
* Basically, `//` means the code is ignored by p5.js. Removing `//` tells p5.js to run the code.
* This code is your **cheat tool** to help find `x, y` coordinates when you click your mouse.

---

### Challenge: Put one shape in the center of each quadrant.

6. **Quadrant 1**: Draw a square using `square(x, y, h)`

   * `h` is the height/width, `x, y` is the location
7. **Quadrant 2**: Draw a rectangle using `rect(x, y, w, h)`

   * Just like `square()`, but you can control the width separately.
8. **Quadrant 3**: Draw a `circle(x, y, d)`

   * `d` is the diameter.
9. **Quadrant 4**: Draw an `ellipse(x, y, w, h)`

   * You can make it tall, wide, or round.

 **You should have:**
- 1 square
- 1 rectangle
- 1 circle
- 1 ellipse
- A background color with **no green**

---

## TODO: Part 2

10. Use `fill()` to change each shape to a different color of your choice.
11. At the **very top** of your code (line 1), answer this question:

> What do `stroke()` and `strokeWeight()` do?

* Use a comment `//` on **line 1** to write your answer.
* You can **cheat** by using the [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/), but **don’t copy and paste**.

12. Beside each shape, add a comment explaining the arguments:

```js
square(111, 111, 50); // x, y, h
```

---

## Final Check:

- File name is **exactly** `10.1.02-Drawing-Shapes`
- You’ve saved it in the editor
- I will check for **this exact name**-**no name = no mark!**

# STARTER CODE to copy into p5.js:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas();
} // end setup – do not delete anything here

function draw() {
  background();

  line(0, 200, 400, 200); // don't touch this
  line(200, 0, 200, 400); // don't touch this

  text("Quadrant 1", 20, 20);   // don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 2", 220, 20);  // don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 3", 20, 220);  // don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 4", 220, 220); // don't touch this
} // end draw – do not delete anything here

// function mousePressed() {
//   print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
// }
```
