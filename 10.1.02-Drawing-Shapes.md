# **The very basic intro to coding**

Our goal today is very simple, learn to colour inside the lines.

  
  ## TODO part 1:
  1. Make a file with the name 10.1.2-Drawing-Shapes
  2. copy the starter code from below, and paste it into the p5js editor. You need to replaice their starter code with mine. 

  3. Inside of `createCanvas(x, y)`; change the x to 400, and y to 400
  4. inside of the `background()` Set it so the any colour you want EXCEPT you are not allowed any green. Add a comment beside and tell me what each number represents. 
    
      

  5. Find the lines the look like this:
 ```
//  function mousePressed() {
//     print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
//   } 
``` 
  delete the `//` to uncomment this code.
        - basicly the `//` are lines of code that p5js doesn't read, you need to delete the `//` from the beginning of each of these lines
        - this code is your cheater that will show you the x,y coordinates when you click your mouse

### Place each of the shapes into the middle of its quadrant. 
  7. **quadrant 1** draw a `square(x,y,h)` h= height/width of the square, and x,y= location. 
  8. **quadrant 2** draw a rectangle using `rect(x,y,w,h)` this is like `square()`, but you can change the width.
  9. **quadrant 3** draw a `circle()`
  10. **quadrant 4** draw a `ellipse()`


## You should have 1 square, 1 rectangle, 1 circle 1 ellipse and a background colour that has no green in it.
  
  10. Use `fill()` and play around with changing each shape to a different colour (any colour, your choice)
  11. At the very top of you what does `stroke()` & `strokeWeight()` do?
  - use comments `//` to put your answer at the **very top of the page on line 1**.
  - you can cheat and use the **[refference](https://p5js.org/reference/)** if you want to, just don't copy/paste 
  12. beside each shape, add a comment `//` and write the "arguments" that go inside the ()
        - arguments are just another name for the numbers you put inside each shape.
This is what i am going to look for:
```javaScript
    square(111 , 111, 50)// x,y,h 
```


## Once you are done, make sure you save. I will look for this exact file name, if I don't see it, you will not be marked. 

# **STARTER CODE to copy into p5js**
```javaScript
function setup() {
  createCanvas();
}// end setup do not delete anything here

function draw() {
  background();
  line(0, 200, 400, 200);// don't touch this
  line(200, 0, 200, 400);// don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 1", 20, 20);// don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 2", 220, 20);// don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 3", 20, 220);// don't touch this
  text("Quadrant 4", 220, 220);// don't touch this


}// end draw do not delete anything here

// function mousePressed() {
//   print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
// }
```
